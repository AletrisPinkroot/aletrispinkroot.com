# Aletris Pinkroot: Official Website

Made with React using the Gatsby frontend for serving.

Using this project to learn react and gatsby, it is going well :)

this is all open source just for fun, i'd prefer if nobody tries to contribute to this considering it's all me learning :) (that being said please do let me know if there's anything dumb that i should fix or should do differently: open for suggestions so i can learn more)
